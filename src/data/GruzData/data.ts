  "I'm currently in my Third year , pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at IPU, Delhi. Although I am familiar with many technologies, as listed in the  section, I primarily work with React with TypeScript and Tailwind for the frontend, and NodeJS and MongoDB for the backend. I have created many cool projects with these technologies, which you can view in the  section . Besides development, I am also skilled in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and practice daily with LeetCode questions, which you can see on my LeetCode profile ."
