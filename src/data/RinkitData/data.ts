  <p>
    Hey! I'm Rinkit Adhana, an undergraduate computer science student and full-stack developer who loves turning ideas into real, working products.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm flexible working with any tech stack, though I prefer modern tools. I'm currently working with Next.js, Django, Express, and TypeScript.
  </p>
  <p>
    I love contributing to open-source projects and have actively participated in multiple hackathons, where I collaborate, build, and solve real-world problems.
  </p>
